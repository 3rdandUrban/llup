## The LLUP Acronym

LLUP loosely stands for the Limited Lifetime Ubiquitous Protocol. Please see [[HistoricalNotes#TheLLUPAcronym](/web/20081119154241/http://dev.llup.org/wiki/HistoricalNotes#TheLLUPAcronym)] for a further understanding of the term "loosely".

### Limited Lifetime

Blip messages have a 'Limited Lifetime' in that they maintain a start [DateTime](/web/20081119154241/http://dev.llup.org/wiki/DateTime) and an expiration [DateTime](/web/20081119154241/http://dev.llup.org/wiki/DateTime), the difference between the two representing the [lifetime](/web/20081119154241/http://dev.llup.org/wiki/LLUP/scope/lifetime) of the message and related content.

### Ubiquitous

Blip messages are 'Ubiquitous' by nature due to the requirement that they are distributed amongst the decentralized ether of LLUP service providers which can exist anywhere, with services provided by anyone who has both the interest and drive to build a company around any potential business model that can be derived from the specification and, most importantly, demand from the marketplace. Similar to email, there is no one central messaging authority that all BLIP messages must pass through en route to their final destination. In this same sense, if a client claims support for BLIP messaging their is no single service provider it must connect to to both publish messages as well as subscribe to messages which in one form or another match topics in which they have interest.

### Protocol

As per the [<span class="icon">Wikipedia entry for Protocol</span>](/web/20081119154241/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(computing)):

> In computing, a protocol is a convention or standard that controls or enables the connection, communication, and data transfer between two computing endpoints. In its simplest form, a protocol can be defined as the rules governing the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of the two.
